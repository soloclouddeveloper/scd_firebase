# About

I am employed by a major healthcare org that uses GCP.  They offer subscription-level learning resources for free,
but beyond the Google Skills Boost labs, I am on my own to learn how to develop on GCP, which I'm okay with.  
I enjoy learning and figuring things out even if I have to do it on my own dime.

How does an individual developer learn cloud technologies and implement enterprise-grade solutions, on Google Cloud Platform, 
out of their own pocket and not rack up insane charges?

That's what I attempt to find out.

I pay for GCP out of my own pocket, without any discounts or credits that aren't available to
anyone.

Things I want to explore:

How to set up a "cheap" blog.
How to schedule automatic project shutdown.
Can billing be disabled from a project without destroying the entire project?
